# Enes Anbar's Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts I use for customizing my UNIX environment to my liking and setting up the software development tools I use on a day-to-day basis. They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.  The included setup script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located in `~/dotfiles/`.

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/enesanbar/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

## Resources

I generally visit the repositories from [GitHub ‚ù§ ~/](http://dotfiles.github.com/) and add the features I like to my repository. Here's the main repositories that my repository is based on aside from the improvements I've made own my own.
